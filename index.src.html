  <h2 id="intro">Introduction</h2>

  <em>This section is not normative.</em>

  Web applications store data locally on a user's computer in order to provide
  functionality while the user is offline, and to increase performance when the
  user is online. These local caches have significant advantages for both users
  and developers, but present risks as well.

  A user's data is both sensitive and valuable; web developers ought to take
  reasonable steps to protect it. One such step would be to encrypt data before
  storing it. Another would be to remove data from the user's machine when it is
  no longer necessary (for example, when the user signs out of the application,
  or deletes their account).

  Site authors can remove data from a number of storage mechanisms via
  JavaScript, but others are difficult to deal with reliably. Consider cookies,
  for instance, which can be partially cleared via JavaScript access to
  <code>document.cookie</code>. <code>HttpOnly</code> cookies, however, can only
  be removed via a number of <code>Set-Cookie</code> headers in an HTTP
  response. This, of course, requires exhaustive knowledge of all the cookies
  set for a host, which can be complicated to ascertain. Cache is still harder;
  no imperative interface to a browser's network cache exists, period.

  This document defines a new mechanism to deal with removing data from these
  and other types of local storage, giving web developers the ability to clear
  out a user's local cache of data via either the <a>Clear-Browsing-Data</a>
  HTTP response header, or the TBD JavaScript API.

  <h3 id="examples">Examples</h3>

  A user signs out of Super Secret Social Network via a CSRF-protected POST to
  <code>https://supersecretsocialnetwork.com/logout</code>, and the site author
  wishes to ensure that locally stored data is removed as a result.

  They can do so by sending the following HTTP header in the response:

  <pre>
    <a>Clear-Browsing-Data</a>: *
  </pre>

  <h3 id="goals">Goals</h3>

  Generally, the goal is to allow web developers more control over the data
  stored locally by a user agent for their origins. In particular, developers
  should be able to reliably ensure the following:

  1.  Data stored in an origin's client-side storage mechanisms like [[INDEXEDDB]],
      WebSQL, Filesystem, {{localStorage}}, and {{sessionStorage}} is cleared.
  2.  Cookies for an origin's host are removed.
  3.  Web Workers (dedicated and shared) running for an origin are terminated.
  4.  Service Workers registered for an origin are terminated and deregistered.
  5.  Resources from an origin are removed from the user agent's local cache.
  6.  All of the above can be propagated to an origin's host's subdomains.
  7.  All of the above can be propagated to the HTTP version of an HTTPS origin.

  ISSUE: With regard to #5, how specific do I need to be? How well is any cache
  specified?

  ISSUE: What about opt-out cookies and the like? Do we need some sort of
  whitelisting mechainsm? Hope not!

  <h2 id="clearing">Clearing Browsing Data</h2>

  Developers may instruct a user agent to clear various types of browsing data
  in two ways: an HTTP response header, and a JavaScript API:

  <h3 id="header">
    The <code>Clear-Browsing-Data</code> HTTP Response Header Field
  </h3>

  The <dfn><code>Clear-Browsing-Data</code></dfn> HTTP response header field
  sends a signal to the user agent that it ought to remove all browsing data
  of a certain set of types. The header is represented by the following ABNF:

  <pre>
    "Clear-Browsing-Data:" *<a>WSP</a> <a>data-type-list</a> *[ ";" *<a>WSP</a> <a>extension</a> *<a>WSP</a> ]  *<a>WSP</a>

    <dfn>data-type-list</dfn> = "*" / ( <a>data-type</a> *( " " <a>data-type</a> ) )
    <dfn>data-type</dfn> = "cookie" / "dom" / "cache"
    <dfn>extension</dfn> = <a>subdomain-extension</a> / <a>unknown-extension</a>
    <dfn>subdomain-extension</dfn> = "includeSubdomains"
    <dfn>unknown-extension</dfn> = *( <a>WSP</a> / &lt;<a>VCHAR</a> except ";" and ","&gt; )
  </pre>

  The header's value contains either the U+002A ASTERISK character
  (<code>*</code>) or a list of type keywords, followed by a set of options.

  The valid type keywords are:

  1.  <code>cookie</code>, which implies that cookies for a host ought to be removed.
  2.  <code>dom</code>, which implies that all DOM-accessible storage for an origin ought to be cleared.
  3.  <code>cache</code>, which implies that all locally cached data for an origin ought to be cleared.

  User agent conformance details are detailed in TODO. Those steps represent the
  following requirements when the header is present in a <a>response</a>
  (<var>response</var>):

  1.  User agents MUST ignore the <a>Clear-Browsing-Data</a> header if it is
      delivered along with a Response whose URL is <a><i lang="la">a priori</i>
      insecure</a>.

  2.  If the value of the header contains "<code>*</code>" or
      "<code>cookie</code>", then all cookies which would be sent along with
      requests to the <var>response</var>'s {{Response/url}} MUST be removed.

      If the <code>includeSubdomains</code> option is present, then all cookies
      which would be sent along with requests to any host which is a subdomain
      of <var>response</var>'s {{Response/url}}'s {{URL/host}} MUST be removed.
      
  3.  If the value of the header contains "<code>*</code>" or
      "<code>dom</code>", then all DOM-accessible storage mechanisms
      ({{localStorage}}, {{sessionStorage}}, [[INDEXEDDB]], [[WEBDATABASE]],
      etc) for <var>response</var>'s {{Response/url}}'s <a>origin</a> MUST be
      cleared.

      If the <code>includeSubdomains</code> option is present, then all
      DOM-accessible storage mechanisms for any <a>origin</a> whose {{URL/host}}
      is a subdomain of <var>response</var>'s {{Response/url}}'s {{URL/host}}
      MUST be cleared.

  The permanent message header field registry should be updated
  with the following registration: [[!RFC3864]]
