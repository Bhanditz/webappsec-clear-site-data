  <h2 id="intro">Introduction</h2>

  <em>This section is not normative.</em>

  Web applications store data locally on a user's computer in order to provide
  functionality while the user is offline, and to increase performance when the
  user is online. These local caches have significant advantages for both users
  and developers, but present risks as well.

  A user's data is both sensitive and valuable; web developers ought to take
  reasonable steps to protect it. One such step would be to encrypt data before
  storing it. Another would be to remove data from the user's machine when it is
  no longer necessary (for example, when the user signs out of the application,
  or deletes their account).

  Site authors can remove data from a number of storage mechanisms via
  JavaScript, but others are difficult to deal with reliably. Consider cookies,
  for instance, which can be partially cleared via JavaScript access to
  <code>document.cookie</code>. <code>HttpOnly</code> cookies, however, can only
  be removed via a number of <code>Set-Cookie</code> headers in an HTTP
  response. This, of course, requires exhaustive knowledge of all the cookies
  set for a host, which can be complicated to ascertain. Cache is still harder;
  no imperative interface to a browser's network cache exists, period.

  This document defines a new mechanism to deal with removing data from these
  and other types of local storage, giving web developers the ability to clear
  out a user's local cache of data via either the <a>Clear-Site-Data</a>
  HTTP response header, or the TBD JavaScript API.

  <h3 id="examples">Examples</h3>

  <h4 id="example-signout">Signing Out</h4>

  A user signs out of Super Secret Social Network via a CSRF-protected POST to
  <code>https://supersecretsocialnetwork.com/logout</code>, and the site author
  wishes to ensure that locally stored data is removed as a result.

  They can do so by sending the following HTTP header in the response:

  <pre>
    <a>Clear-Site-Data</a>: *
  </pre>

  <h4 id="example-killswitch">Kill Switch</h4>

  Super Secret Social Network's developers learn that the site was vulnerable
  to cross-site scripting attacks which allowed malicious parties to inject
  arbitrary code into its origin. They fixed the site, and added a strong
  Content Security Policy [[CSP2]] to mitigate the risk going forward, but
  they can't be entirely sure that clients are really back to a trustworthy
  state. Perhaps the attackers found a clever persistence mechanism?

  They can reduce the risk of a persistent client-side XSS by sending the
  following HTTP header in a response to wipe out local sources of data:

  <pre>
    <a>Clear-Site-Data</a>: *
  </pre>

  Note: Installing a Service Worker guarantees that a request will go out to
  a server every ~24 hours. That update ping would be a wonderful time to send
  a header like this one in case of catastophe. [[SERVICE-WORKERS]]

  <h3 id="goals">Goals</h3>

  Generally, the goal is to allow web developers more control over the data
  stored locally by a user agent for their origins. In particular, developers
  should be able to reliably ensure the following:

  1.  Data stored in an origin's client-side storage mechanisms like [[INDEXEDDB]],
      WebSQL, Filesystem, {{localStorage}}, and {{sessionStorage}} is cleared.
  2.  Cookies for an origin's host are removed [[!RFC6265]].
  3.  Web Workers (dedicated and shared) running for an origin are terminated.
  4.  Service Workers registered for an origin are terminated and deregistered.
  5.  Resources from an origin are removed from the user agent's local cache.
  6.  All of the above can be propagated to an origin's host's subdomains.
  7.  All of the above can be propagated to the HTTP version of an HTTPS origin.

  ISSUE: What do we do about today's multi-tab, multi-window user agents? Should
  we also neuter open execution contexts in the affected origins? Close open
  windows?

<section>
  <h2 id="clearing">Clearing Site Data</h2>

  Developers may instruct a user agent to clear various types of relevant data
  in two ways: an HTTP response header, and a JavaScript API:

  <h3 id="header">
    The <code>Clear-Site-Data</code> HTTP Response Header Field
  </h3>

  The <dfn><code>Clear-Site-Data</code></dfn> HTTP response header field
  sends a signal to the user agent that it ought to remove all data
  of a certain set of types. The header is represented by the following ABNF:

  <pre>
    "Clear-Site-Data:" *<a>WSP</a> <a>data-type-list</a> *[ ";" *<a>WSP</a> <a>extension</a> *<a>WSP</a> ]  *<a>WSP</a>

    <dfn>data-type-list</dfn> = "*" / ( <a>data-type</a> *( " " <a>data-type</a> ) )
    <dfn>data-type</dfn> = "cookie" / "dom" / "cache"
    <dfn>extension</dfn> = <a>subdomain-extension</a> / <a>unknown-extension</a>
    <dfn>subdomain-extension</dfn> = "includeSubdomains"
    <dfn>unknown-extension</dfn> = *( <a>WSP</a> / &lt;<a>VCHAR</a> except ";" and ","&gt; )
  </pre>

  The header's value contains either the U+002A ASTERISK character
  (<code>*</code>) or a list of type keywords, followed by a set of options.

  The valid type keywords are:

  1.  <code>cookie</code>, which implies that cookies for a host ought to be
      removed.

  2.  <code>dom</code>, which implies that all DOM-accessible storage for an
      origin ought to be cleared.

  3.  <code>cache</code>, which implies that all locally cached data for an
      origin ought to be cleared.

  ISSUE: This should probably be changed into a mechansim which excludes certain
  types. That is, I see a use case for skipping cookies. I don't see any for
  skipping DOM storage or Cache. Perhaps drop down to <code>*</code> and
  <code>everything-but-cookies</code>?

  Invalid type keywords present in a header's value are simply ignored. Parsing
  details can be found in [[#parsing]].

  User agent conformance details are detailed in [[#clear]]. Those steps
  represent the following requirements when the header is present in a
  <a>response</a> (<var>response</var>):

  1.  User agents MUST ignore the <a>Clear-Site-Data</a> header if it is
      delivered along with a Response whose URL is <a><i lang="la">a priori</i>
      insecure</a>.

  2.  If the value of the header contains "<code>*</code>" or
      "<code>cookie</code>", then all cookies which would be sent along with
      requests to the <var>response</var>'s {{Response/url}} MUST be removed.

      If the <code>includeSubdomains</code> option is present, then all cookies
      which would be sent along with requests to any host which is a subdomain
      of <var>response</var>'s {{Response/url}}'s {{URL/host}} MUST be removed.

  3.  If the value of the header contains "<code>*</code>" or
      "<code>dom</code>", then all DOM-accessible storage mechanisms
      ({{localStorage}}, {{sessionStorage}}, [[INDEXEDDB]], [[WEBDATABASE]],
      etc) for <var>response</var>'s {{Response/url}}'s <a>origin</a> MUST be
      cleared.

      If the <code>includeSubdomains</code> option is present, then all
      DOM-accessible storage mechanisms for any <a>origin</a> whose {{URL/host}}
      is a subdomain of <var>response</var>'s {{Response/url}}'s {{URL/host}}
      MUST be cleared.

  4.  If the value of the header contains "<code>*</code>" or
      "<code>cache</code>", then all locally cached data for
      <var>response</var>'s {{Response/url}}'s {{URL/host}} MUST be removed.

      If the <code>includeSubdomains</code> option is present, then all locally
      cached data for any host which is a subdomain of <var>response</var>'s
      {{Response/url}}'s {{URL/host}} MUST be removed.

  <h3 id="fetch-integration">Fetch Integration</h3>

  ISSUE: Monkey patching! Talk with Anne.

  If the <a><code>Clear-Site-Data</code></a> header is present in an HTTP
  <a>response</a>, then data MUST be cleared before rendering the response to
  the user. That is, before step #9 in the current <a>main fetch</a> algorithm,
  execute the following step:

  9.  If <var>response</var>'s <a>header list</a> contains a header named
      <a><code>Clear-Site-Data</code></a>, then execute [[#clear]] on
      <var>response</var>.

  Note: This happens <em>after</em> <code>Set-Cookie</code> headers are
  processed. If we clear cookies, we clear all of them.

  <h3 id="parsing">Parsing</h3>

  <h4 id="get-types">
    Which data types ought to be cleared for <var>response</var>
  </h4>

  TODO: Parse the <a><code>Clear-Site-Data</code></a> header. Return
  a list of type names.

  <h4 id="should-include-subdomains">
    Should subdomains' data be cleared for <var>response</var>
  </h4>

  TODO: Parse the <a><code>Clear-Site-Data</code></a> header. Return
  either <dfn><code>Include Subdomains</code></dfn> or <dfn><code>Exclude
  Subdomains</code></dfn>.

  <h4 id="matches-origin">
    Does <var>origin</var> match <var>origin to clear</var> and
    <var>subdomains</var>
  </h4>

  TODO: Given an origin, the origin to clear, and the "include subdomains"
  flag, return <dfn><code>Matches</code></dfn> or <dfn><code>Does Not
  Match</code></dfn>.

  <h3 id="clear">
    Clear data for <var>response</var>
  </h3>

  Given a <a>response</a> (<var>response</var>), this algorithm parses the
  <a><code>Clear-Site-Data</code></a> header to determine what needs to be
  cleared, which origins are affected, and then executes those requests.

  1.  Let <var>types</var> be the result of [[#get-types]] executed on
      <var>response</var>.

  2.  Let <var>subdomains</var> be the result of [[#should-include-subdomains]]
      executed on <var>response</var>.

  3.  If <var>types</var> contains "<code>cookie</code>", execute
      [[#clear-cookies]] on <var>response</var>'s {{Response/url}}'s
      <a>origin</a>, with <var>subdomains</var>.

  4.  If <var>types</var> contains "<code>dom</code>", execute [[#clear-dom]]
      on <var>response</var>'s {{Response/url}}'s <a>origin</a>, with
      <var>subdomains</var>.

  5.  If <var>types</var> contains "<code>cache</code>", execute
      [[#clear-cache]] on <var>response</var>'s {{Response/url}}'s
      <a>origin</a>, with <var>subdomains</var>.

  <h4 id="clear-cache">
    Clear cache for <var>origin</var> with <var>subdomain state</var>
  </h4>

  Given an <a>origin</a> (<var>origin</var>) and a <var>subdomain state</var>
  of either <a><code>Include Subdomains</code></a> or <a><code>Exclude
  Subdomains</code></a>, this algorithm removes data from the user agent's
  local caches that matches the origin and subdomain state.

  1.  Let <var>host</var> be <var>origin</var>'s {{URL/host}},
      <a>canonicalized</a> as per Section 5.1.2 of [[!RFC6265]].

  2.  If <var>subdomain state</var> is <a><code>Include Subdomains</code></a>,
      then let <var>cache list</var> be the set of entries from the <a>network
      cache</a> whose <code>target URI</code>'s {{URL/host}}
      <a>domain-matches</a> <var>host</var> when <a>canonicalized</a> as per
      Section 5.1.2 of [[!RFC6265]]

  3.  Otherwise, <var>subdomain state</var> is <a><code>Exclude
      Subdomains</code></a>, so let <var>cache list</var> be the set of
      entries from the <a>network cache</a> whose <code>target URI</code>
      {{URL/host}} is identical to <var>host</var> when <a>canonicalized</a> as
      per Section 5.1.2 or [[!RFC6265]].

  4.  Remove each <var>entry</var> in <var>cache list</var> from the <a>network
      cache</a>.

  5.  If a user agent implements caches beyond a pure <a>network cache</a>, it
      MUST remove all entries from those caches which match <var>origin</var>
      and <var>subdomain state</var>.

      ISSUE: We're dealing with the network cache here, as defined in
      [[!RFC7234]], but that's not nearly everything a user agent caches. How
      hand-wavey with the vendor-specific section can we be? For instance,
      Chrome clears out prerendered pages, script caches, WebGL shader caches,
      WebRTC bits and pieces, address bar suggestion caches, various networking
      bits that aren't representations (HSTS/HPKP, SCDH, etc.).

  <h4 id="clear-cookies">
    Clear cookies for <var>origin</var> with <var>subdomain state</var>
  </h4>

  Given an <a>origin</a> (<var>origin</var>) and a <var>subdomain state</var>
  of either <a><code>Include Subdomains</code></a> or <a><code>Exclude
  Subdomains</code></a>, this algorithm removes cookies from the user agent's
  <a>cookie store</a> whose <code>domain</code> attribute matches the origin
  and subdomain state.

  Note: This algorithm assumes that the user agent has implemented a <a>cookie
  store</a> (as discussed in Section 5.3 of [[!RFC6265]]), which offers the
  ability to retrieve a list of cookies by host, and to remove individual
  cookies.

  1.  Let <var>host</var> be <var>origin</var>'s {{URL/host}},
      <a>canonicalized</a> as per Section 5.1.2 of [[!RFC6265]].

  2.  If <var>subdomain state</var> is <a><code>Include Subdomains</code></a>,
      then let <var>cookie list</var> be the set of cookies from the <a>cookie
      store</a> whose <code>domain</code> attribute <a>domain-matches</a>
      <var>host</var>.

  3.  Otherwise, <var>subdomain state</var> is <a><code>Exclude
      Subdomains</code></a>, so let <var>cookie list</var> be the set of
      cookies from the <a>cookie store</a> whose <code>domain</code> attribute
      is identical to <var>host</var>.

  4.  Remove each <var>cookie</var> in <var>cookie list</var> from the <a>cookie
      store</a>.

  <h4 id="clear-dom">
    Clear DOM-accessible storage for <var>origin</var> with
    <var>subdomains</var>
  </h4>

  1.  For each <var>area</var> in the user agent's set of <a>local storage
      areas</a> [[!HTML]]:

      1.  If [[#matches-origin]] returns <a><code>Matches</code></a> when
          executed on <var>area</var>'s <a>origin</a>, <var>origin</var>, and
          <code>subdomains</code>:

          1.  Execute {{Storage/clear()}} on the {{Storage}} object associated
              with <var>area</var>.

  2.  For each <var>area</var> in the user agent's set of <a>session storage
      areas</a> [[!HTML]]:

      1.  If [[#matches-origin]] returns <a><code>Matches</code></a> when
          executed on <var>area</var>'s <a>origin</a>, <var>origin</var>, and
          <code>subdomains</code>:

          1.  Execute {{Storage/clear()}} on the {{Storage}} object associated
              with <var>area</var>.

  3.  For each <var>database</var> in the user agent's set of Indexed
      Databases [[!INDEXEDDB]]:

      1.  If [[#matches-origin]] returns <a><code>Matches</code></a> when
          executed on <var>database</var>'s <a>origin</a>, <var>origin</var>,
          and <code>subdomains</code>:

          1.  Set <var>database</var>'s <a>delete pending</a> flag to
              <code>true</code>.

          2.  For each <var>connection</var> in the set of all {{IDBDatabase}}
              objects connected to <var>database</var>:

              1.  Execute the <a>database closing steps</a> on
                  <var>connection</var>.

          3.  Execute the <a>database deletion steps</a> on
              <var>database</var>, passing in <var>database</var>'s
              <a>origin</a> and name.

  4.  For each <var>database</var> in the user agent's set of WebSQL
      databases [[!WEBDATABASE]]:

      1.  If [[#matches-origin]] returns <a><code>Matches</code></a> when
          executed on <var>database</var>'s <a>origin</a>, <var>origin</var>,
          and <code>subdomains</code>:

          1. Delete <var>database</var>.

             ISSUE: The [[WEBDATABASE]] spec is fairly unhelpful here with
             regard to deletion details.


  ISSUE: Define how we clear Filesystems, Dedicated Workers, Shared Workers, Service Workers, etc.
